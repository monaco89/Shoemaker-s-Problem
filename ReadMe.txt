Shoemaker’s Problem. 
Shoemaker has N jobs (orders from customers) which he must make. Shoemaker can work on only one job in each day. For each ith job, it is known the integer Ti (1<=Ti<=1000), the time in days it takes the shoemaker to finish the job. For each day of delay before starting to work for the ith job, shoemaker must pay a fine of Si (1<=Si<=10000) cents. Your task is to help the shoemaker, writing a program to find the sequence of jobs with minimal total fine.
Input: First line of input contains an integer N (1<=N<=1000). The next N lines each contain two numbers: the time and fine of each task in order.
Output: You program should print the sequence of jobs with minimal fine.
